# P2C2M_Migrate
Implementation of P2C2M with Migrate-n

This repository includes R scripts for the Posterior Predictive Checks of Coalescent Models (P2C2M) R package. This version conducts posterior predictive checks of output from Peter Beerli's Migrate-n program that estimates migration rates. Note: although the scripts are operational, at present this pipeline should not be used to detect model violations.
